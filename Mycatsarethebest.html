			<p>I know it looks like I am just being biased, but my cats truly are the best cats in the world. They are each very unique.</p>

			<p>My one cat, Mindy, is the cutest and most snuggly cat ever. She is a slim cat with tan, gray, white, and brown fur. 
			Not only does she have stripes, but she also has spots. Additionally, Mindy sleeps with me every night and is super soft.</p>
			<p>My second cat's name is Bubbie. It was originally Frankie, but the nickname stuck. He is extremely fat and fluffy. 
			He is part Maine Coon so he is very big naturally. He ABSOLUTELY LOVES food and drinking out of the sink. 
			He is extremely dog-like, and at times can be very grumpy.</p>
			<p>My last cat is Loki. He is all Maine Coon. He is very big but since he is only a few years old, he is still growing. He loves Bubbie. 
			He likes to play with orange mice only and to be chased. He sometimes can be a jerk though. He always wants to be pet, but when we go to pet him, he runs away.
			But when you catch him or he let's it happen, he becomes very cuddly. </p>
