			<h2>Overview</h2><!--basic information about animal and where it lives-->
				<p>The Amur leopard is one of the world’s most rare big cats. It is one of the nine subspecies of leopard. Amur leopards hunt a variety 
				of animals such as roe and sika deer, hares and badgers. Their fur helps them blend in with their surroundings as well as keeps them cool
				in summers and warm in winter, adapting to fit the circumstance.  The Amur leopard can run at speeds of up to 37 miles per hour and has 
				also been known to jump more than 20 feet long and up to 10 feet high. It is a very powerful and large cat. They can live up to 10-15 
				years in the wild and 20 in captivity; on average they can be expected to live about 14-16 years.</p>

				<p> Amur leopards live in the temperate forests of Far Eastern Russia. They experience weather patterns ranging from extreme winters 
				with lots of snow to hot summers. Amur Leopards are located in Southwest Primorye in the Far East of Russia as well as along the Russian
				border in the Heilongjiang Province and the Jilin Province in North East China.</p> 

			<h2>Is it Endangered?</h2> <!--why and conservation efforts-->
				<p>The Amur Leopard is one of the most endangered species. It is listed as “critically endangered” and is at extreme risk of extinction-
				 currently less than 100 are left living in the wild. There are numerous reasons why these beautiful creatures are on the brink of 
				 extinction. <b>Poaching</b> is a big threat for these leopards. Their habitat is located relatively close to major cities
				 leading to these animals being hunted for sport and for food. They are also hunted for their fur and bones which are 
				 common in traditional Asian medicine. Additionally, <b>Forest Fires</b> reduce the amur leopard's natural habitat and replace it 
				 with grasslands that the leopards avoid living in. <b>Development</b> in major cities adjacent to the home of this species is
				 encroaching on the leopards’ territory by building new railways, gas and oil pipelines, and ports as well. <b>Diseases</b> like 
				 Canine Distemper Virus (CDV), threaten the Amur leopard population. Lastly, <b>dwindling</b> numbers of their primary <b>food source</b>, native deer, 
				 have forced amur leopards to hunt domesticated livestock, which leads to persecution by local farmers.</p>

			 	<p>Today, there are many conservation efforts in place to ensure the preservation of the Amur Leopard population. European, North 
			 	American, and Asian zoos with captive amur leopards are participating in controlled breeding programs that allow for the regrowth of
			 	the species and creation of additional genetic diversity. Additionally, many efforts, by groups like WWF, are being made to put an 
			 	end to the poaching and illegal trading of the leopards. Conservation groups are also monitoring the leopards in the wild and trying 
			 	to increase the populations of their prey to provide a solid foundation for the species. Protecting their land is also a major 
			 	concern. Finally, efforts are being made to regulate forestry practices and logging and increasing the amount of protected land.
